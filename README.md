# testandlearnllm
# Objective

Try to test and in the process learn about llms


# installandstart.sh 
contains commands for creating a virtual python env installing dependencies and running facebook/opt-2.7b model locally
Took around 5 gb of local storage and 10 gb of ram
using openllm. Tested only on mac might need modification for windows
Models downloaded are stored at ~/bentoml/models in mac

# start.sh
Once eveything required is installed just start.sh is enough to start the server

Further objective to test other llms
